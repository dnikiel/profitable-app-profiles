# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

> This notebook is result of guided project made during data analysis course from dataquest.io platform.

## Project background:

We are working as data analyst for softwarehouse which wants to create a profitable, free mobile application for App Store and Google Play Markets. Main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app.

Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
